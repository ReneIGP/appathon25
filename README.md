### Interactive city exploration with Google Maps and AI

This website allows users to explore places using Google Maps Street View or by uploading photos of locations. Based on the user's location or the selected image, the AI will identify the place and provide historical and contextual information about it. If no such information about the place is found, new closest place with historical meaning will be prompted. Users location updates as he explores the city.
